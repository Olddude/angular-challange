# Objective

## Use the latest version of Angular (no additional frameworks/libraries) and TypeScript to render an

## arbitrary deeply nested object, for example:

###
```js
{
  a: true,
  b: 1 ,
  c: 'Hello, World!',
  d: {
    e: 'I am a nested string!',
    f: {
      g: {
        h: {
          i: 'So am I!',
          j: false,
          k: 123 ,
          l: 'And I am last!'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Use three types of inputs to display the values: check boxes for booleans, input type numbers for

## numbers and text boxes for strings.

## Additional: try to style the UI as best as you can (again, no additional frameworks/libraries,

## however you can use a preprocessor, like for example SCSS).
